  Hi!
A (better?) Let Me Think
  Let Me Think (LMT) was has problems with gasoline containers like gas bottles and Fuel API's large gas canisters interacting with fuel pumps and cars and lucky us there is an alternative. This version fixes all that and it also has much less code doing ~all the same things! 

  None of this code is mine, so don't expect to receive updates (doesn't mean I won't try correct bugs)! Produced by Tyrir, shared by @Neznajka, uploaded by @Auratian.
  Original code found on original LMT mod's discussion: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2033451936
  
  Enjoy!

Know Issuess:
  When paused
    -vehicle buttons don't work
    -vehicle radial won't open
    -vehicle mechanics window not interactable
  When unpaused
     -none
